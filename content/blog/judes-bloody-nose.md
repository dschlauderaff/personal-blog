title: Jude's bloody nose
description: family shenanigans

The other morning, as I was getting the boys up to get ready for school, Jude greeted me by telling me that he had had a bloody nose during the night.

Now, the twins have been known to stretch the truth a little bit when it comes to what is actually a "bloody nose", so I took a quick look at him, saw that his nose was a little crusty red, but otherwise fine, and left it at: "Ok, bud. Your nose looks fine."

I go about waking up Gabriel, and then walk into the boys bathroom... It looked like an abbatoir. Apparently, Jude really did have a nosebleed in the night, a fairly large one. There was blood spattered on the sink, down the cabinet, on the tiles, on the stepstool. Biblical.

There was a bloody towel in the sink. It seems he had the nosebleed, then tried to clean up with a hand towel soaked in water. As I set to cleaning up, Laura asked why he didn't come to get us. He said that he tried calling out (we are on the other side of the house, with fans, white noise, etc), but no one came.

So, +1 for independance, I suppose.
